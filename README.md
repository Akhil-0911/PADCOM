# Medical Image Analysis System for Pneumonia and Brain Tumor Detection

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement
Medical imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing various health conditions. However, manually analyzing X-ray images is time-consuming, requires expertise, and is prone to errors. This project aims to develop an image analysis system capable of detecting **pneumonia in chest X-rays** and **tumors in brain MRI scans**, providing a preliminary assessment that can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

### 1.2 Motivation
Early detection of pneumonia and brain tumors can significantly improve patient outcomes. Traditional diagnosis relies on manual interpretation, which may lead to delays or misdiagnosis. By leveraging deep learning techniques, this system automates the detection process, making medical analysis faster and potentially reducing human error. This tool can serve as a **preliminary screening system** that, when further developed, could assist in clinical settings.

### 1.3 Objectives
- Develop a system that detects **pneumonia in chest X-rays** and **tumors in brain MRIs**.
- Integrate **Improved Pneumonia Model** for pneumonia detection and **ResNet-18** for brain tumor detection.
- Provide a simple user interface for uploading X-ray or MRI images and receiving results.
- Explore the potential of deep learning in improving **medical imaging diagnostics**.

### 1.4 Scope of the Project
- The system analyzes **chest X-ray images** for pneumonia detection and **brain MRI scans** for tumor identification.
- It does not classify the severity of pneumonia or tumor but only detects their presence.
- The system is not validated for **clinical use** but can be developed further for medical applications.
- Users must manually upload images for analysis.

## 2. Literature Survey

### 2.1 Review of Existing Work
Several AI-based solutions have been proposed for medical image analysis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used due to their high accuracy in image classification tasks. Models like ResNet, VGG, and DenseNet have demonstrated strong performance in detecting abnormalities in medical images.

### 2.2 Existing Techniques
- **Pneumonia Detection:** Traditional detection methods rely on radiologists manually examining X-ray images. AI models like DenseNet and EfficientNet have been used for automated detection.
- **Brain Tumor Detection:** MRI scans are manually analyzed by medical experts, but deep learning models such as ResNet and U-Net have shown potential in automating tumor identification.

### 2.3 Identified Gaps
- Many existing models require **high computational power**, making real-time deployment difficult.
- Most systems focus on either **pneumonia or brain tumors**, but not both in a single solution.
- Limited **user-friendly interfaces** for direct usage by non-technical users.

**How This Project Addresses These Gaps:**
- Uses **lightweight models (Improved Pneumonia Model & ResNet-18)** for faster detection.
- Provides a **web-based interface** using **HTML and CSS**, allowing easy image uploads.
- Combines **two medical conditions (pneumonia and brain tumors)** into a single detection system.
